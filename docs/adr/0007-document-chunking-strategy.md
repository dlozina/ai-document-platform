# ADR-007: Document Chunking Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
For large documents, we need to break them into smaller chunks for embedding generation and storage. This is necessary because:
1. Embedding models have token limits
2. Vector search works better with smaller, focused chunks
3. Large documents can cause memory issues

## Decision
We will implement **intelligent document chunking** with the following strategy:

### Chunking Parameters
- **Chunk Size**: 1000 characters per chunk
- **Chunk Overlap**: 200 characters overlap between chunks
- **Chunking Method**: Text-based chunking with overlap

### Chunk Metadata
Each chunk includes:
- `chunk_id`: Unique identifier for the chunk
- `chunk_index`: Position in the document
- `total_chunks`: Total number of chunks in document
- `start`/`end`: Character positions in original text
- `text`: The actual chunk content

### Storage Strategy
- Store each chunk as a separate vector in Qdrant
- Maintain chunk relationships through metadata
- Enable retrieval of full document context when needed

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Better Search**: Smaller chunks provide more focused search results
- **Memory Efficiency**: Avoids memory issues with large documents
- **Flexible Retrieval**: Can retrieve specific parts of documents
- **Scalability**: Can handle documents of any size

### Negative
- **Storage Overhead**: More vectors to store and manage
- **Complexity**: Need to handle chunk relationships
- **Context Loss**: Risk of losing context between chunks

## Implementation Timeline
- **2025-10-03**: Added document chunking functionality
- **2025-10-03**: Implemented chunk metadata tracking
