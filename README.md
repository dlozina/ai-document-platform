## 🎯 What is this platform?

This is an **AI-powered platform** designed to revolutionize how Human Resources teams handle candidate applications and documents. Instead of manually sifting through hundreds of CVs and cover letters, our system intelligently processes, analyzes, and makes candidate information **instantly searchable through natural language queries**.

### 💡 **The Magic**: Ask Questions, Get Answers
> **"What programming languages does this candidate know?"** → *Instant, accurate answer*
> 
> **"Find candidates with 5+ years of Python experience"** → *Ranked list of matches*

## ❌ The Problem We Solve

Traditional hiring processes are **time-consuming and inefficient**:

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| 🔍 **Manual Review** | HR teams spend hours reading through CVs one by one |
| ⚖️ **Inconsistent Evaluation** | Different reviewers may miss key qualifications |
| 📈 **Scalability Issues** | Processing hundreds of applications becomes overwhelming |
| 📄 **Information Overload** | Important details get lost in lengthy documents |

## ⚙️ How This Platform Works
