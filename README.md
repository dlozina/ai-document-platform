# AI-Powered HR Document Intelligence Platform

Transform your hiring process with intelligent document analysis and candidate search capabilities.

## What is this platform?

This is an AI-powered platform designed to revolutionize how Human Resources teams handle candidate applications and documents. Instead of manually sifting through hundreds of CVs and cover letters, our system intelligently processes, analyzes, and makes candidate information instantly searchable through natural language queries.

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional hiring processes are time-consuming and inefficient:
- **Manual Review**: HR teams spend hours reading through CVs one by one
- **Inconsistent Evaluation**: Different reviewers may miss key qualifications

- Extracts text from PDFs or images
- Processes video content for spoken information
- Identifies key entities (names, skills, experience, education)
- Creates searchable embeddings of all content

### 2. **Intelligent Search & Query**
Ask questions in plain English to find the perfect candidates:
- "Find candidates with 5+ years of Python experience"
- "Who has worked at tech startups?"

### 3. **Comprehensive Candidate Profiles**
